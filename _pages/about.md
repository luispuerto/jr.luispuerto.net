Luis Puerto Díaz [was born on December 5 on 2019][birth] and we create this blog to share with you and specially with our son the _adventure_ of parenting. 

Luis Puerto Díaz is the fourth Luis in the family, after both his grandfathers and his father. Is the third Luis Puerto, after his grandfather and father. But, **he is a unique Luis Puerto Díaz**. 

The two main contributors to the blog are going to be his parents, Olalla Diaz Yañez and Luis Puerto, but the contributions are probably going to be open to almost everyone that want to share their thoughts with him and with the rest of the world. 

We are still working on how to share pictures —the most demanding thing that people as you to— with all of you in a safe way. But this days, to be hones, it's pretty difficult. We as parents, don't own the image, or any other thing, related to our son. But we are mere custodians of it, until he is old enough to manage for himself. For this very reason all the content on this blog is owned by him and in consequence by his parents until the legal age comes. 

We also decided to write mainly in English language, although we are thinking to create a mirror of this blog in Spanish, since we think that Luis Puerto Díaz is a _true European_, since both his parents are Spanish but he was born in Finland.  

Finally, you have to think this is just a work in progress site, and although we thought about this before, it's still a lot to be thought and decided, and right now we are still overwhelmed by the recent birth. 

Soon more to come.
